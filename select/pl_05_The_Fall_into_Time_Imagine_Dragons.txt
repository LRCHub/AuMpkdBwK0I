Our curse
The fall into time
(Our curse)
Now cross
The threshold of death
(Now cross)
Through tempest and fire
and a night without end
Transcending all illusion
With violent precision
and destructive intent
Into the pit of death
To search for the answers -
Outside of yourself
A civilization of dreaming death
To work among,
your darkest of dreams
The eternal wound of existence
Bound to the horrors,
the horrors of life
This paranoia of the heart
By trauma exhausted -
Oblivion tamed
Through fear and corruption -
To deep to explain
The hallucinations -
Perverted through time
Primordial nightmares -
A horror divine
Adoration of our primeval dread
In the darkest of illusions dead
These virgin sunsets
This dimensional complex torn
Through disintegration
Now cross (Now cross)
The threshold of death
Our curse
The fall into time
(Our curse)
To search for the answers
Outside of yourself
A civilization
The Fall into time
Adoration of our primeval dread
In the darkest of illusions dead
These virgin sunsets
This dimensional complex torn
Through disintegration
Now cross (Now cross)
The threshold of death
Our curse
The fall into time
(Our curse)
