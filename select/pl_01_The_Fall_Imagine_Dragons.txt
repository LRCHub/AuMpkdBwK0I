maybe I'm broken
maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner
than I should have
only the good die old
that's what they told me
but I don't know
maybe I'm breaking up
with myself
maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep
to the things that
I've been told
wait for the colors
to turn to gold
do you know
do you know
you're all I know
you're all I know
when everything
comes crashing down
you're all I know
you're all I know
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that
I believed in to drift away
ready for the leaves
ready for the colors
to burn to gold
and crumble away
maybe I'm destined
to be distraught
always a reason
breaking me down
to my knees
in the dead of night
I keep on praying
to see the light
maybe I'm breaking up
with myself
maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep
to the things that
I've been told
wait for the colors
to turn to gold
do you know
do you know
you're all I know
you're all I know
when everything
comes crashing down
you're all I know
you're all I know
do you know
do you know
you're all I know
you're all I know
when everything
comes crashing down
you're all I know
you're all I know
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that
I believed in to drift away
ready for the leaves
ready for the colors
to burn to gold
and crumble away
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
you were the one
you were the one
you were the one
who helped me see
you were the one
you were the one
oh you gave it all to me
I'm ready for the fall
ready for the leaves
ready for the colors to
burn to gold and crumble away
